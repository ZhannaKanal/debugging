JavaScript Errors

A SyntaxError happens when you write something incorrectly in your code, like missing a paranthesis, or a bracket. Think of it like a grammar mistake in a sentence. 
const arr = ["Beau", "Quincy" "Tom"] // each array element needs to be separated by a comma otherwise it will result in an error message.

A ReferenceError has several reasons, first of it would be not defined variables.
console.log(price); // Reference error
we want log price var, but it hasnt been defined.
Another is trying to access a variable, declared with const and let, before it has been defined.
console.log(b);
const b = 50;
result Cannot access "b" before initialization.
Third is TypeError occur when you try to perform an operation on the wrong type.
const developerObj = {
  name: "Jessica",
  country: "USA",
  isEmployed: true
};
developerObj.map()
result developerObj.map is not a function, cause map method is used for arrays, not objects
Last is RangeError happens when your code tries to use a value that's outside the range of what JS can handle. 
const arr = [];
arr.length = -1; 
since array's length has to be a non-negative integer, setting it to -1 triggers a RangeError.
